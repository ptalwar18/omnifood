 Three ingredients to Responsive Web Design
    1. Fluid grid: all layout elements are sized in relative units such as percentages, instead of absolute units like pixels.
    2. Flexible Images : are also sized in relative units. <so they are not sized outside of their parent elements>
    3. Media queries: allow us to specify different CSS style rules for different browser widths.
    
margin: top right bottom left
